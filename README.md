# CS 426 - Homework 04

----
# Project Overview:
This is an enhanced version of the HW02 game, in which players race to collect computer parts from buildings and turn them in while avoiding being shot by other players.
# Two Physics Constructs
- Trampoline: On collision, vertical force applies to the player, giving them air time. The player can use this to their advantage to dodge bullets or reach "part buildings" slightly faster.
- Speed Conveyor: On collision and staying collided, applies forward force to the player which gives them extra speed to reach different sides of the map faster.
# Billboard
Billboards have been added above each part building to represent what part the building gives to the player.
# Two New Lightings
- Warm directional lighting that covers the whole scene and casts soft shadows. This makes the environment feel active, which is fitting since this game is a race.
- Cool blue spotlight over the turn in station that collects parts in a player's inventory. This cool and bright spotlight makes the turn in station stand out in the warm-lighted environment, which is useful for the player since it indicates the importance of it.

## Important Submission Details:
- A build can be found in the "Output" folder.
