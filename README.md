# Project Overview:

This project revolves around exercise 4 of the CS 426 course at UIC.  Specifically, the goal of this project is as follows:

"This is a team-based assignment; you will work as a group along your assigned in-class group.  The result of this assignment will be a second Unity 3D game for your portfolio (the first being your Assignment 1). However, this game will be a (very, very) simple serious multiplayer networked game. For this assignment, your task is to continue working as a group and produce, in 14 days, a lightweight implementation of the simple mechanics game you designed in class. The reading next week (“How to Prototype a Game in 7 Days”, written by four game design students) may come in handy."

# Minimum Requirements:

Your game, while respecting the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Silly)

- [ ] 1.) Must be 3D, and

- [ ] 2.) Must follow loosely a “Computer Architecture and Thieves” theme (your resources may be logical components, the goal might be to cache something, the environment might be inside a physical machine, your players might be thieves etc.) and

- [ ] 3.) Must use at least one less common procedure/rule, in the vein of your Procedures/Rules exercise last week and

- [ ] 4.) Must be a multiplayer, networked game, and

- [ ] 5.) Must include a billboard with some text on it asking the serious test question, and

- [ ] 6.) Must have a serious objective; i.e., by the end of the game, players should be able to answer correctly the test question you spelled out in E04. You may assume the test question would be answered outside the game, perhaps on paper; and

- [ ] 7.) Must be accompanied by a README file with the names of your teammates, and briefly describing your FEs, including the multiplayer aspect, the unusual procedure/rule, how you followed the game theme, and the serious objective and question/answer.


Items 5) and 6) are extremely lightweight points.

As a reminder, the basic architecture of a computer typically looks like this:

# Grading:

Grade will be based on:
- `20pts` design, quality and rigor of the 3D FEs (or formal elements)
- `20pts` at least one unusual procedure/rule
- `10pts` networking works
- `10pts` look and feel of your game aligned with the theme
- `10pts` billboard with serious question shown
- `10pts` README file
- `10pts` how much fun playing the game is
